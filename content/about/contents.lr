My name is Nicole Weber and I design products at [Ableton](http://ableton.com), a music software company based in Berlin. Before joining Ableton, I worked as UX designer for the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence Berlin](http://www.dfki.de/web?set_language=en&cl=en) and finished my master thesis at University of Applied Science Potsdam and d.school Potsdam with a focus on user-centered innovation. 

I love to tell stories based on observations of peopleâ€™s daily endeavors and to create design solutions that [connect people](/blog/dont-do-it-alone/). I believe in working together and in iterations.

In my free time I enjoy reading science-fiction, tap dancing and the Talking Heads. I prefers handshakes over hugs.

Things we could talk about over coffee:
Working together, Talking Heads, Coffee
